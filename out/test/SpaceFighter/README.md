# SpaceFighter

This is a space-shooter 2D game written in Java. The project began shortly after beginning a search for open source code that contained a rudimentary game engine to hack on. I found a game tutorial that supplied such code ... and thus Space Fighter was born!

Special thanks to Jan Bodnar who provided the original base code for the project. You can check out the original here:

The project is ongoing with hacks and tweaks as well as refactoring occuring frequently.
