# SpaceFighter

##Gameplay
WASD for guns, arrows for movement, just like the good ol' days.

No Jar as of yet. For the moment by simply loading the project into IntelliJ or Eclipse and running the program gameplay should be accesible. Defender is presently the only game mode with more or less complete functionality. Enjoy!

##About
This is a space-shooter 2D game written in Java. The project began shortly after beginning a search for open source code that contained a rudimentary game engine to hack on. I found a game tutorial that supplied such code ... and thus Space Fighter was born!

Special thanks to Jan Bodnar who provided the original base code for the project. You can check out the original here:

The project is ongoing with hacks and tweaks as well as refactoring occuring week to week.
